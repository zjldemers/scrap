# scrap: A(nother) Linux Trash CLI
It's a simple, intuitive (I hope) command line interface to a user's Trash bin, based off of the [FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html).  It is strictly Linux systems only, as far as I'm concerned, but maybe someday it could be expanded to cover other platforms as well.

## History
I - along with many others, I'm sure - made the mistake of using "rm" in the Linux terminal a litle too quickly, quickly regretting the action afterwards.  This led to a brief search to find a better means of tossing files in a way that I could recover them if needed, while also being able to erase them forever if desired.  Something like the standard trash GUI that comes on most operating systems, but handled through the terminal.

I soon found that there are indeed options out there such as [@andreafrancia's trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli/), or [@atharvakadam's Trash-Suite](https://github.com/atharvakadam/Trash-Suite-Linux), or [@nivekuil's rip](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip).  However, they all had shortcomings for what I was going for.  Plus, I saw it as a good opportunity to practice some skills on my own, so here I am.
