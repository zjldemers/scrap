# scrap: A(nother) Linux Trash CLI
It's a simple, intuitive (I hope) command line interface (CLI) to a user's Trash bin, based off of the [FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html).  With that in mind, this is intended for use on Linux machines only.

## History
I - along with many others, I'm sure - made the mistake of using "rm" in the Linux terminal a litle too quickly, soon after regretting the action.  This led to a brief search to find a better means of tossing files in such a way that I could recover them if needed, while also being able to erase them forever if desired.  Something like the standard trash GUI that comes on most operating systems, but handled through the terminal since I frequently work from there.

I quickly came across several options such as [@andreafrancia's trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli/), or [@atharvakadam's Trash-Suite](https://github.com/atharvakadam/Trash-Suite-Linux), or [@nivekuil's rip](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip).  However, they all had shortcomings for what I was going for.  Many of these were more complex than what I desired, and some were not very intuitive to me, for example.  Plus, I saw it as a good opportunity to practice some skills on my own, so here I am.
